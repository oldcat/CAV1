# about  skeleton.out  and attachment.out 
#
Each line in skeleton.out corresponds to a joint and is of the form:
idx x y z prev where prev is the index of the previous joint.

The skeletons are composed of 21 bones (22 joints).
The ID of the bone is same as the ID of the joint in skeleton2.out. 
In attachment2.out, the weights for each bone is listed.    

Each line in attachment.out corresponds to a mesh vertex and
consists of bone weights for each bone in the order of bone IDs.
